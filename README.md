# MiniProjects

There are three sections in this part

1. Train a machine learning model (preferably with a neural network) that 
predicts the customer who is going to be checked in. Once done, please test 
the prediction with below test data.

2. Do a thorough analysis on the results and the dataset with visualizations (please feel free to add creative ways of visualization here).

3. Host/Deploy the results using any hosting service you want (streamlit/flask)
